# emacs-picat-mode
This is a fork of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rurban/picat-lang/master/picat-mode.el, with two modifications to suit my preferences: (1) disabling automatic indentation when pressing the Tab and Return keys, and (2) ensuring that pressing the Tab key inserts four spaces instead of a tab character.
